5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    We are trying to implemented a web app that use the gestures to decide how each picture display on the page,
    for example if a close hand detected then the image will have a particular animation to pop up this photo.
    The final version should have a photo gallery which will display each photo at a time,
    and base on the gestures, the web app will automatically display the next photo in the gallery
    with the special animation. In addition, the photo gallery is more like a carousel.
    Unfortunately, we didn't get the time to fully implemented this function for each of the gestures that we have.
    So the current version will just display a image without the animation.
    The gestures that we have right now are as follows:
        Two open hands
        Closed hand
        Two closed hand
        Pointing
        Pimching
        And two custom gestures: "One open One close" and "One open one pointing"
